I run most of the analysis in notebooks, just because it's easier for me to document what's going on in each section.

I like quarto, but this could just as easily be a jupyter notebook.

The main thing I wanted to illustrate here is how easy it is to add in our helper functions!

```{python}
from template_workflow import helpers

helpers.my_helper_function()
```
